# MazeAlgorithms
Dynamic User - defined Maze that is solved using a selection of algorithms

This porject uses SFML-2.5.1

This is a work in progress, and will be updated regularly upon completion of a complete new system.
All Builds of the Project and their different versions are provided in the Builds folder, however the source is only the most up to date build.
Due to Project setup all the builds will also be built in debug mode, and win 32, however, feel free to use the source and make your own release build.

This only works on windows (I believe), so keep that in mind, it uses sleep for the delay, which is easily change-able, but I am not sure if this sfml version has linux or any other capabilities
