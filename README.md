# MazeAlgorithms
Dynamic User - defined Maze that is solved using a selection of algorithms

This porject uses SFML-2.5.1

None of the SFML files are included in the repo, however the linker and lib folder are setup for a drag and drop into the solution directory folder, the .dlls go into the project directory (without the folder)
SFML can be downloaded here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php if 2.5.1 is not the latest stable version, check the previous version tab.

This is a work in progress, and will be updated regularly upon completion of a complete new system.
All Builds of the Project and their different versions are provided in the Builds folder, however the source is only the most up to date build.


This only works on windows (I believe), so keep that in mind, it uses sleep for the delay, which is easily change-able, but I am not sure if this sfml version has linux or any other capabilities
